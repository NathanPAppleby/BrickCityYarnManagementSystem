# yarnmanagementsystem
Repo for yarn management system
## Inspiration
Our inspiration was team member Ella's struggle to keep all her 
fiber art projects in one place, along with keeping track of her yarn.
## What it does
It keeps track of both a user's yarn storage and projects under 
a login system. It allows you to add and remove yarns from your storage, along with adding and removing items from 
a "shopping cart" of yarn you need. The project feature allows users to add and delete "projects", which include a name, 
a pattern link, and the yarn needed. The projects are organized into three queues, in queue - work in progress - complete.
## How we built it
We built this project using Java and the database through Google Cloud Platform.
## Challenges we ran into
We ran into a few issues with the database interacting with preexisting Java code and making that work together. 
However, after testing we figured out the problems together and worked towards a solution.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of our implementation of the Google Cloud Platform, as none of us have worked in the cloud before 
or implemented it into a project. It took awhile and a lot of testing, but we are very happy to have it implemented.
## What we learned
We learned a lot about database management and UI menu systems, both of which will support our education and careers in the future.
## What's next for Brick City Yarn Management System
Next, we plan to expand this into a full desktop app that will synch with a mobile app, so that you 
can add and remove items from storage and your shopping cart on the go, along with being able to check your shopping cart while at the store.
